# Introduction
This repository contains the code for training a network to learn a language model and then use the model to generate new sequences. The model will be trained to learn the language of music of [Johann_Sebastian_Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach).
For this, the model will learn how J.S Bach's "Cello suite" have been composed.
